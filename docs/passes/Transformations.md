### `-llhd-function-elimination`: Deletes all functions.

Deletes all functions in the module. In case there is still a function
call in an entity or process, it fails.
This pass is intended as a post-inlining pass to check if all functions
could be successfully inlined and remove the inlined functions. This
is necessary because Structural LLHD does not allow functions. Fails in
the case that there is still a function call left in a `llhd.proc` or
`llhd.entity`.
### `-llhd-process-lowering`: Lowers LLHD Processes to Entities.
